# Super Awesome RPG Game (No title yet)

This super awesome RPG game will be a first person RPG game, where you can either play alone or with up to 4 friends.

The game will have different classes to choose from. Some ideas so far:
- Warrior
  - Slow, but heavy attacking class with high health/armor.
- Archer
  - Ranged, agile, low health class
- Mage (Might become healer / damge hybrid)
  - Ranged class, with medium health and damage.
- Rogue
  - Low health melee class with high agility and damage
- Cleric
  - Healer / Support class.

Some other ideas for the game so far:
- Released on Steam
- Open world / Exploration (Kind of like World of Warcraft, but smaller)
- 3D
- First-Person Shooter (Aim skills at monsters, don't just aimlessly spam spells on the monster you targeted 2 mins ago)
- Unlock spells as you level up
- Fun to play in a party, but also playable alone
- Inventory for equipment that the player can wear to become stronger
- Blacksmith where you can upgrade equipment
- Towns
  - Quests
  - Vendors
  - Blacksmith
- Dungeons
